            "\n",
            "### 1. Using `for` Loops:\n",
            "A `for` loop is typically used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or a range of numbers).\n",
            "\n",
            "**Example: Iterating through a list**\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "This will output each number in the list. Using `for` is generally preferred when you know the number of iterations or are working with iterable objects.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Using `while` Loops:\n",
            "A `while` loop continues to execute as long as a certain condition is `True`. This is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Example: Counting down from 5**\n",
            "\n",

            "- **Infinite Loops**: Be careful with `while` loops that might never reach a condition that stops them.\n",
            "- **Complexity**: Keep loops simple. If you're performing complex logic, consider breaking it out into functions.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. Using `break` and `continue`:\n",
            "These keywords help control loop execution. `break` exits the loop, while `continue` skips to the next iteration.\n",

            "Answer: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to the tendency of a CEO or founder to hire someone weak for an executive role in their former area of expertise, in order to maintain control and continue to be seen as the leading authority in that function. This pattern can lead to poor performance within that department, as the executive hired may lack the necessary strength or skills, allowing the CEO to feel more comfortable remaining involved in the decision-making process. The term is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who struggled to turnaround ABC after acquiring it, reflecting how a strong leader can sometimes hire less capable executives to avoid relinquishing control.\n",
